<h1>Mission</h1> 
<p> We aim to impact the present and make history in the same breath.â€‹
Sign Now is an international start-up that specializes in on-demand sign language translation for the deaf community - anywhere and anytime.

Our company is made up of a combination of both deaf and non-deaf employees. The professional aspect is managed entirely by our deaf managers, who stand at the forefront of all our activity. 

Over the past 5 years, we have succeeded in bringing international recognition to sign language. </p>

 
<h1>Vision</h1 >
<p>Sign Now is the only international social start-up that provides on-demand sign language services across the globe. 

We are challenging the status quo in the international sign language translation market by creating the most advanced solutions at the social, business and technological levels. 
concurrently, and no less important - we aim to provide the option of making large physical events accessible to sign language interpretation, as we did successfully with the Eurovision song contest. </p>
